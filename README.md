## What is this

At its core, newtype OS is an **8-agent multi-layer orchestration system** equipped with specialized skills and a memory system, purpose-built for content production.

Think of it as **a content team living in your terminal**. The Chief (Editor-in-Chief) talks to you, breaks down requirements; the Deputy dispatches execution; 6 specialists each handle their domain — research, fact-checking, retrieval, extraction, writing, and editing.

```
You ↔ Chief (Editor-in-Chief)
          ↓
      Deputy (Deputy Editor)
          ↓
      Researcher · Fact-Checker · Archivist · Extractor · Writer · Editor
```

## Comparison

|                 | @newtype-os/plugin           | @newtype-os/cli                  |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Nature**      | OpenCode plugin              | Standalone terminal app          |
| **Install**     | `bun add @newtype-os/plugin` | `npm install -g @newtype-os/cli` |
| **Requires**    | OpenCode                     | Self-contained, no dependencies  |
| **Launch**      | `opencode`                   | `nt`                             |
| **Config dir**  | `~/.config/opencode/`        | `~/.config/newtype/`             |
| **Project dir** | `.opencode/`                 | `.newtype/`                      |

### Key Differences

`@newtype-os/cli` isn't "OpenCode with a plugin bolted on." It integrates OpenCode as its core engine and ships as a standalone product. You install it, run `nt`, and the full 8-agent team is ready. `@newtype-os/plugin`, on the other hand, is a standard OpenCode plugin that adds the same agent team to an existing OpenCode installation.

The CLI operates in its own configuration namespace: `~/.config/newtype/` for global config, `.newtype/` for project-level files. This is completely separate from OpenCode's `~/.config/opencode/` and `.opencode/`. Installing the CLI won't touch your existing OpenCode setup, and it won't interfere with any OpenCode plugins you already have installed (such as oh-my-opencode). The two coexist without conflict.

From a feature standpoint, both versions deliver the same experience. The 8-agent team, built-in skills, memory system, CLI commands, and MCP integrations are identical regardless of which version you pick. You're not giving anything up by choosing one over the other.

If you want a self-contained setup that works out of the box, or if you already run other OpenCode plugins and prefer clean separation, go with the CLI. If you're already an OpenCode user and simply want to add the newtype agent team to your existing workflow, the plugin is the lighter-weight option.

Supported platforms: macOS (Apple Silicon / Intel), Linux (x64 / ARM64), Windows (x64).

## Installation & Usage

newtype OS is designed for both humans and agents.

### For Humans

#### Option 1: newtype CLI (Recommended)

A ready-to-use terminal AI assistant with the full agent team built in.

```bash
npm install -g @newtype-os/cli

# Launch the TUI
nt
```

#### Option 2: As an OpenCode Plugin

If you already use [OpenCode](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode):

```bash
cd ~/.config/opencode
bun add @newtype-os/plugin
```

Edit `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`:

```json
{
  "plugin": ["newtype-profile"]
}
```

### For Agents

After installing newtype CLI, the system ships with a full set of CLI commands (`nt research`, `nt write`, `nt pipeline`, etc.) designed specifically for agent invocation.

Run `nt init` and newtype will automatically detect locally installed AI development tools and inject skill files, teaching agents how to use these CLI commands:

```bash
npm install -g @newtype-os/cli
nt init
```

Supported tools: Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, Windsurf, Cline, Roo Code, Zed, Goose, Amazon Q, and more.

Once injected, these agents know when and how to call `nt research`, `nt pipeline`, and other commands to augment their own capabilities.

## Configuration

### Connect Model Providers

Use the `/connect` command in the TUI to connect model providers (75+ supported), or via CLI:

```bash
nt auth login
```

### Configure Agent Models

**Option 1**: Use the `/agent-models` command in the TUI to configure models for each agent through the interface.

**Option 2**: Edit the config file directly.

- newtype CLI: `~/.config/newtype/newtype-profile.json`
- OpenCode plugin: `~/.config/opencode/newtype-profile.json`

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "chief": { "model": "your-preferred-model" },
    "deputy": { "model": "your-preferred-model" },
    "researcher": { "model": "your-preferred-model" },
    "writer": { "model": "your-preferred-model", "temperature": 0.7 }
  }
}
```

All 8 agents can be configured with independent models and parameters.

### Customize Chief's Personality

Create `.newtype/SOUL.md` (or `.opencode/SOUL.md` for the OpenCode plugin) to customize Chief's communication style:

```bash
/init-soul  # Generate default template
```

### Disable Features

```json
{
  "disabled_agents": ["fact-checker"],
  "disabled_skills": ["super-analyst"],
  "disabled_hooks": ["memory-system"],
  "disabled_mcps": ["sequential-thinking"]
}
```

## Features

### Agent Team

| Agent            | Role            | Responsibility                                             |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Chief**        | Editor-in-Chief | Your entry point — thought partner + task coordinator      |
| **Deputy**       | Deputy Editor   | Chief's execution layer, dispatches downstream specialists |
| **Researcher**   | Researcher      | External intelligence gathering, trend discovery           |
| **Fact-Checker** | Verifier        | Fact verification, source credibility assessment           |
| **Archivist**    | Archivist       | Internal knowledge base retrieval and correlation          |
| **Extractor**    | Extractor       | PDF/image/web content extraction to Markdown               |
| **Writer**       | Writer          | Transforms materials into structured first drafts          |
| **Editor**       | Editor          | Language polish, logic strengthening, style consistency    |

**You only interact with Chief.** Chief automatically dispatches other agents as needed.

### Built-in Skills & MCP Servers

Agents auto-load the corresponding skill framework when executing tasks:

| Skill                  | Command               | Description                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Super Workflow**     | `/super-workflow`     | Scaled content workflow with quality gates for non-trivial work             |
| **Super Analyst**      | `/super-analyst`      | Decision analysis, structured research, and framework selection             |
| **Super Writer**       | `/super-writer`       | Content drafting with lightweight methodology and style control             |
| **Super Fact-Checker** | `/super-fact-checker` | Claim extraction, verification, source assessment, and corrections          |
| **Super Editor**       | `/super-editor`       | Edit existing content and explain material changes                          |
| **Super Interviewer**  | `/super-interviewer`  | Thought clarification, requirement discovery, and Socratic questioning      |
| **Super Obsidian**     | `/super-obsidian`     | Obsidian CLI-first vault operations: search, read, create, and manage notes |

Super Workflow is the orchestration layer that governs the entire content lifecycle — it defines *when* to do *what* and *how* to verify quality at each stage. Super Writer and Super Editor provide the professional techniques for execution. Chief auto-loads the relevant skill when a task calls for a structured framework. You can also trigger them manually via slash commands. Super Obsidian is auto-loaded when an Obsidian vault (`.obsidian/` directory) is detected.

| MCP                     | Default  | Config             |
| ----------------------- | -------- | ------------------ |
| **websearch** (Exa)     | Enabled  | None required      |
| **sequential-thinking** | Enabled  | None required      |
| **tavily**              | Disabled | Requires `api_key` |
| **firecrawl**           | Disabled | Requires `api_key` |

### CLI Commands

Beyond the TUI, newtype provides a set of specialized commands for CLI and agent invocation (all support `--json` output):

| Command                 | Agent(s)                  | Description                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `nt research [topic]`   | Researcher + Fact-Checker | Deep research + source verification            |
| `nt write [topic]`      | Writer                    | Multi-style content generation                 |
| `nt edit [file]`        | Editor                    | 4-layer content refinement                     |
| `nt fact-check [topic]` | Fact-Checker              | Fact-checking and cross-verification           |
| `nt analyze [topic]`    | Chief + Researcher        | Framework-based structured analysis            |
| `nt extract`            | Extractor                 | Extract content from files/URLs/images         |
| `nt archive <action>`   | Archivist                 | Knowledge base CRUD and semantic search        |
| `nt pipeline [topic]`   | Full orchestration        | Research → Analyze → Write → Fact-check → Edit |

Examples:

```bash
# Research a topic and output a report
nt research "AI Agent architecture trends 2026" -o research.md

# Write an article based on research
nt write --input research.md --style newsletter -o draft.md

# Full pipeline in one command
nt pipeline "The future of MCP" --style essay --output-dir ./output/
```

### WeChat Integration

newtype CLI has built-in [WeClaw](https://github.com/fastclaw-ai/weclaw) integration, bridging your WeChat with the full agent team via the [ACP (Agent Client Protocol)](https://github.com/nicepkg/acp). Send a message to your WeChat account, and Chief will handle it — research, write, fact-check, all from WeChat.

| Command            | Description                                                |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nt wechat setup`  | Download WeClaw binary + scan QR code to link WeChat       |
| `nt wechat start`  | Start the WeChat agent bridge (auto-updates before launch) |
| `nt wechat stop`   | Stop the WeChat agent bridge                               |
| `nt wechat status` | Show installed version and running state                   |

Quick start:

```bash
nt wechat setup    # One-time: download + QR login
nt wechat start    # Start the bridge daemon
```

The agent bridge runs in the background. WeChat messages are routed to newtype's ACP server, which dispatches them to Chief using your configured model. No API key needed for WeChat — it uses the official [iLink API](https://ilinkai.weixin.qq.com).

### Memory System

newtype has a built-in automatic memory system — no manual management needed:

- **Daily summaries**: Auto-generated LLM summaries after session idle, stored in `.newtype/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Full transcripts**: Complete conversation history per session in `.newtype/memory/full/`
- **Long-term memory**: Old logs auto-archived to `.newtype/MEMORY.md` every 7 days
- **Auto-recall**: Relevant memories are automatically retrieved and injected into context during conversations

Use `/memory-consolidate` to manually trigger archival.

### Knowledge Base

newtype provides two knowledge base initialization commands to help agents quickly understand your project:

| Command      | Generated File | Description                                                                                  |
| ------------ | -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/init`      | `AGENTS.md`    | Project-level instruction file defining agent behavior and context for the current project   |
| `/init-deep` | `KNOWLEDGE.md` | Deep knowledge index that auto-scans project structure and generates a detailed codebase map |
